## What is this
This was my way of learning about, and experimenting with:

 - Numerical methods for the Navier-Stokes equations (incompressible flow);
 - Discrete adjoint method, there is a geometry and mesh generation module for turbo-machinery so that the code can be used for optimization;
 - Implementation strategies (domain decomposition, shared memory, GPU);
 - Many other things (linear solvers, preconditioners, graphs, etc.);

## Compilation
The code is setup to compile with [CodeBlocks](https://www.codeblocks.org/).

## Dependencies
[Eigen v3](http://eigen.tuxfamily.org/index.php?title=Main_Page)

## Usage
See examples and tests.
