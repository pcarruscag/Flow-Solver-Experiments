# BUG 1
Sympton:
    Solver is crashing because it is failing to match periodic faces

Possible causes:
1)  The difference in radial/axial coordinate suggests that the problem is not
    due to numerical accuracy
    The face groups are not being populated correctly
2)  The matching is based on centroid coordinates, these are not being computed
    correctly

Cause investigation:
1)  Each periodic face has 96 faces (8 meri * 12 span), 24 per partition
    Every partition has 30 inlets, 30 outlets and 48 periodic faces
    Inner partitions have 60 walls and 360 ghost faces
    End partitions have 240 walls and 180 ghost faces
    The correct number of boundaries is being created
    The z coordinates of the periodic faces are not inside the blade region

Cause:
    The wrong face was being marked as "mapped", code was trying to map a face
    that was already mapped before


# BUG 2
Sympton:
    Segfault while allocating the sparse matrices

Cause:
    The index of the face was being used instead of the index of the partition
    in the boundary vector


# BUG 3
Sympton:
    Assertion for expected number of coefficients == obtained number is failing
    while allocating the sparse matrices

Possible causes:
1)  Eigen is prunning the 0 coefficient.

Cause investigation:
1)  Set the first coefficient to a non zero value. This was not the problem.

Cause:
    Variable coeffNum is the index of the last coefficient which is 1 smaller
    than the number of coefficients in the matrix, coeffNum incremented at the
    end so it represents number of coefficients
